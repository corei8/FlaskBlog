			The Thesis of Cassiciacum is a theological explanation of the crisis of authority in the Catholic Church
			caused
			by the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). It was conceived by the Dominican bishop Most Rev. Gu√©rard des
			Lauriers, and
			first published in 1979 in the magazine <em>Cahiers de Cassiciacum.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			All Catholics who are interested in the traditional movement within the Catholic Church ought to benefit
			from familiarizing themselves with the Thesis of Cassiciacum. The reason is that, broadly speaking, the
			Thesis offers a justification for the traditional movement by reconciling the duty to submit to religious
			authority with the
			duty to preserve the traditional doctrine, worship, and law of the Church prior to the Second Vatican
			Council.

			Our objective in creating this website is to make the Thesis easily accessible to the English-speaking
			public.
			We warmly encourage all Catholics interested in the traditional movement within the Catholic Church to
			browse
			the
			materials found here. It is our hope that all who do so will profit from the intellectual heritage of His
			Excellency Bishop des
			Lauriers in understanding the nature of the present crisis in the Church, and in working toward a truly
			Catholic
			resolution.
