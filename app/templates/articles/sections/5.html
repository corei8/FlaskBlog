Elements involved in the making of a pope.</h3> <p>Let us consider the requisite determinations which are brought together in the person of a pope. The 1917 Code of Canon Law, can. 219, indicates:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Roman Pontiff, legitimately elected, as soon as he accepts the election, receives by divine law, the full power of supreme jurisdiction.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are therefore three elements which found the affirmation that someone is the pope:</p> <ol> <li>legitimate election</li> <li>acceptance of the election by the elected person</li> <li>the full power of supreme jurisdiction, received by divine law</li> </ol> <p>These three elements have separate causes: election is carried out by the electors; acceptance is given by the person elected; and the supreme power is communicated to him by God.</p> <p>We can therefore clearly see the three stages of the formation of a pope. First, a group of men (the college of cardinals) lawfully elect a candidate. Second, this candidate accepts the papacy. Third, God bestows upon the elected man the supreme authority over the Church, thus making him the pope.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#5-elements-involved-in-the-making-of-a-pope">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
