Comparison and differences between the papacy and a natural authority.</h3> <p>As we have said, a law issued against the common good is no law at all. In civil powers, one illegitimate law would not however necessarily render its lawgiver illegitimate, if the later preserves a habitual order to the common good. One would have to ignore the illegitimate law and observe the other ones.</p> <p>There is, however, this important difference with the supreme authority of the Church. In the case of the papacy, as we have seen previously, the supreme authority is constituted by an immediate communication from Christ. Now, the assistance of the Holy Ghost has been divinely promised with this habitual communication from Christ. The Roman Pontiff is therefore infallibly assisted by Christ, and could never promulgate a universal law which would be harmful to the Church, as is explained in another section of this website.</p> <p>Hence, while it is sometimes justified to 'recognize' a civil government while 'resisting' its unjust laws, this policy can never be justified with regard to the supreme government of the Holy Catholic Church and its universal laws.</p> <p>As a consequence, the Roman Pontiff either possesses supreme authority, or he does not possess supreme authority. There is no middle ground possible. The habitual intention to procure the common good of the Church is still required, however, in order to receive this authority from Christ, since it is the essential end for which was instituted the papacy.</p>  <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#24-comparison-and-differences-between-the-papacy-and-a-natural-authority">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
