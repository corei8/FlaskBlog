<h3 id="12-different-alternatives-are-possible-in-the-interval-between-election-a-acceptance">12. Different alternatives are possible in the interval between election a acceptance.</h3> <p>As a matter of fact, the elect can either accept or refuse the election, or do neither. In the case of acceptance, he becomes a true pope. In the case of refusal, he returns to the state he was before the election, and someone else could, and should, be elected in his place. In the case of neither acceptance nor refusal, which is the more interesting, he remains the elect of the conclave without as yet being a true pope, endowed with supreme authority, for as long as he does not make a decision. The current situation of the papacy, as we shall explain, is a little bit half-way between someone who has truly accepted and someone who has neither accepted nor refused: the elect has indeed accepted exteriorly (as is evident), but not internally (as we shall prove).</p> <p>The situation during this interval is therefore not one of pure vacancy of the Roman See. Again, Bonacina says it in clear terms (ibid., emphasis added):</p> <blockquote> <p>Secondly, it does not follow that the Apostolic See is simply (simpliciter) vacant while the election has been made by the Cardinals and the person elected has not yet given his consent, as when the person elected is an absent Cardinal (as happened to Adrian VI who was in Spain in 1521), for even though the election has not yet achieved its full effect and the Apostolic See is not yet said to be occupied, for as long as the consent of the person elected has not followed; but the Apostolic See is not vacant on account of this, because the See is said to be vacant when it does not have a Pontiff in any way, but in our case it does have a Pontiff in a certain way, since a pope has already been elected, and even though he has not yet been created, he nevertheless has been as though conceived and exists, so to speak, in the womb.</p> </blockquote> <p>The last determination of the matter, prepared to receive the form of the papacy, is therefore the internal consent of the elect. Even in the case of a legitimate election, and assured of the promise of Christ to grant authority on the legitimate successor of St. Peter, the last condition still needs to be posited for validity: a sincere internal acceptance of the papacy by the elect.</p>  <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#12-different-alternatives-are-possible-in-the-interval-between-election-a-acceptance">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
