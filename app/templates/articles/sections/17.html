A marriage consent given externally could be internally invalid.</h3> <p>It is well-known that the consent given outwardly during a marriage ceremony could be vitiated by an internal lack of proper intention, if one of the spouses does not truly intend what marriage objectively is. Moral theologians explain that this is clearly the case (1) when the intention does not correspond to the objective essence of marriage, or even in some cases (2) when certain essential properties (such as indissolubility) are positively excluded, despite an inefficacious acceptance of the nature of marriage.Thus if one of the spouses were to posit internally a defect of consent with regards to the primary end of marriage, the marriage, although juridically recognized by the Church, would not be valid in the eyes of God. There would really be no contract, no sacrament, and the spouses would not be truly married. This would be a very serious sin on the part of the spouses who thus simulated the matrimonial consent and consequently rendered the marriage invalid. However, from the perspective of human law, the marriage has happened, and is presumed to be valid until otherwise established. At the same time, under the law, the spouses are not free to marry again, but are legally married. If they are aware of this invalidity, they cannot in good conscience ask one another to render the marital debt, since they know that they are not married before God. But since they enjoy the external presumption of the law, any children born of them is recognized as legitimate by the law. The situation could be remedied by petitioning the Church for a juridical declaration of nullity of the marriage bond, called an annulment. Even better, the guilty spouse could internally amend and correct his or her intention, now accepting the indissolubility of marriage, thus rendering the marriage truly valid. This could happen even without the knowledge of the other spouse, supposing the other spouse kept the first intention to marry.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#17-a-marriage-consent-given-externally-could-be-internally-invalid">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
