<h3 id="9-the-acceptance-of-the-election">9. The acceptance of the election.</h3> <p>By its nature, the intellect seeks to know the essence of a reality of which it grasps the existence. Now, the absence of authority in the Vatican II popes is known as a fact, as we have explained, but it is not yet understood as to the manner by which this lack of authority is brought into being.</p> <p>We know as a fact that the Vatican II popes, despite apparently valid elections, have not received the supreme authority from Christ. Is this possible? The answer is in the affirmative, since between a legitimate election and the reception of authority from God intervenes a middle act, as we have seen: the acceptance of the election by the person elected. This is an act of the will, on the part of the elect, which should be manifested externally, but by its very nature needs also to be internal to be valid. In other words, it is necessary that the elect sincerely have and express his acceptance of the election. By a simple act of the will, therefore, the elect can choose to receive the supreme authority of the Church, or refuse it. He may also accept it for a time, and then willingly resign it later on; Pope St. Celestine (1215-1296) is a well-known example of this. This simple act of the will is called the acceptance.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#9-the-acceptance-of-the-election">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
