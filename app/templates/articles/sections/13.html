The act of acceptance is a human act.</h3> <p>So far, we have underlined the necessity that the acceptance of the papacy be not only externally manifested but also internally sincere in order to be valid. It is now time for us to prove it.</p> <p>The acceptance of the papacy (like the election, or any legitimate ecclesiastical act) is what is called a human act. In theology, human acts are distinguished from acts of man in that they are not mere acts done by a subject independently of his control (such as digestion), but that they do imply knowledge and consent of the subject. Any moral act is a human act. Thus a sin, in order to be such, should not only have been objectively committed, but should have been so through knowledge and consent. These are the very elements of a human act, they are intrinsic to it, and belong to its very nature. Legitimate ecclesiatical acts, such as election, are human acts. Indeed, canon 167 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law clearly denies any right of election to someone unable to produce a human act. Similarly, an election obtained through grave threats imposed on the electors is invalid, because they would have lacked the proper consent which ought to be given to such an action, despite the external vote.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#13-the-act-of-acceptance-is-a-human-act">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
