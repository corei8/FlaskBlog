Pope Leo XIII on the question of intention in the case of Anglican orders.</h3> <p>Pope Leo XIII has declared the invalidity of the Anglican orders by the Bull Apostolicae curae, of 1896, on account of a defect both of form and of intention. Concerning the intention of the minister, Pope Leo XIII explains:</p> <p>The Church does not judge about the mind and intention, in so far as it is something by its nature internal; but in so far as it is manifested externally she is bound to judge concerning it.</p> <p>Pope Leo XIII makes it clear that an intention is by nature something internal, and which is manifested externally. He further confirms that this intention is able to be judged not inasmuch as it is internal, but inasmuch as it is being manifested externally, which is the same principle used by the Thesis in the present argument.</p> <p>A further comment may be here made on the following words of Leo XIII in the same Bull:</p> <blockquote> <p>If the rite be changed, with the manifest intention of introducing another rite not approved by the Church and of rejecting what the Church does, and what, by the institution of Christ, belongs to the nature of the Sacrament, then it is clear that not only is the necessary intention wanting to the Sacrament, but that the intention is adverse to and destructive of the Sacrament.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pope Leo XIII clearly explains that to deliberately reject a rite of the Church, replacing it with another that does not anymore reflect "what, by the institution of Christ, belongs to the nature of the Sacrament," is tantamount to not having the required intention. We shall see later how to guard the sacraments of the Church and in particular to safeguard the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass must be intended by the person who accepts the election to the papacy. It appears then very clearly as a consequence that to intend to deliberately reject the traditional Roman rite and to replace it with another that does not anymore reflect "what, by the institution of Christ, belongs to its nature," would also, by analogy, be a clear defect of intention in the acceptance of the papacy.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#22-pope-leo-xiii-on-the-question-of-intention-in-the-case-of-anglican-orders">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
