<h3 id="2-the-vatican-ii-popes-are-not-in-fact-true-popes">2. The 'Vatican II popes' are not in fact true popes.</h3> <p>The Thesis agrees with complete sedevacantism (sometimes called 'totalism') in saying that the Vatican II popes are not true popes. This is a fact admitted by both sides using an indirect argument based on the Church's infallibility: the Vatican II popes, who have appeared to enjoy supreme authority over the Church, have universally promulgated errors in doctrine, liturgy, and discipline; they have done so under conditions where they should have been infallible. Therefore, either they are not popes, or the Church is not infallible. Since Catholic faith forbids us from professing the latter, the former must be true.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#2-the-vatican-ii-popes-are-not-in-fact-true-popes">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
