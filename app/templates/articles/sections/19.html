To accept the papacy is to accept what the pope is objectively meant do.</h3> <p>To accept the papacy validly, the elected candidate must accept it as it is objectively, i.e. as established by Christ. This is to say that the acceptance of the papacy ought to be a human act: done with proper knowledge and consent. The person elected to the papacy must have the intention of doing what popes do in order to be the pope.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#19-to-accept-the-papacy-is-to-accept-what-the-pope-is-objectively-meant-do">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
