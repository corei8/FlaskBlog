<h3 id="11-interval-between-election-and-acceptance">11. Interval between election and acceptance.</h3> <p>In the interval between the election and the acceptance, the elect alone has the material aspect of the papacy (still requiring to be completed by the acceptance), but not yet the formal aspect. The duration of this interval is able to be determined by the electors, but in itself is indefinite.</p> <p>Bonacina explains again (ibid.):</p> <blockquote> <p>A greater difficulty is whether the College of Cardinals has any power over the person elected, who has not yet accepted the election. It seems to me that one should answer with Sopranus (in the above-quoted place) that they have the power to order him that he accept the election as soon as possible, or that he decline it, if he be unwilling to accept it. The reason is that during the vacancy of the See the whole College has power over each single Cardinal, at least in those things that pertain to the election, [as can be seen in] the above-quoted chapter Ubi Periculum: hence it can force the elected to person to accept the election or to decline it, if he is unwilling to accept it.</p> </blockquote> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#11-interval-between-election-and-acceptance">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
