<h3 id="27-another-example-taken-from-church-history">27. Another example taken from Church history.</h3> <p>During the terrible crisis of the great Western Schism, there were up to three simultaneous claimants to the papacy, three 'popes' at the same time, each claiming to be the only real one. One claimant was residing in Rome (Gregory XII), another in Avignon (Benedict XIII), and the last one in Pise (John XIII). Ultimately, two of them (John XIII and Benedict XIII) were deposed by the Council of Constance, and the other (Gregory XII) renounced the papacy. It was very difficult in this period for Catholics to know which pope was the true pope, and this has continued to be discussed by historians, although there seems to now be a consensus that Gregory XII was the true pope. This touches on the question of a doubtful pope. Papa dubius, papa nullus, says the axiom, a doubtful pope is no pope. But it could happen (and this was the case of Gregory XII) that a true pope, validly elected, and therefore truly possessing the supreme authority over the universal Church may become doubtful, not before God and in reality (coram Deo), but in the common estimation of men and in the eyes of the Church (coram Ecclesia). On account of the supreme necessity for the Church to know with certainty the identity of her supreme pastor, the Church is in this case entitled to assess the situation and require from doubtful popes that they resign, following a process similar to that reserved to the heretical pope. After the general Council has asked the doubtful pope to resign, even if he should refuse, he would have proven guilty of a schismatical attitude by not attending to this extreme need of the Church, and therefore clearly deprived of the authority of Christ, in case he formerly had it. In other words, even if, by hypothesis, a true pope before God and in reality but doubtful before the Church would refuse to resign his claim, he would by this refusal actually lose the papacy anyway, since to refuse to cooperate in such a grave matter is tantamount to schism. This is the explicit teaching of great theologians such as Azor, Cajetan, Suarez, John of St. Thomas, Zapelena, etc. And these were the principles applied by the Council of Constance to solve the great Western Schism. Incidentally, a false council in Pise tried to do something similar, and pretended to depose the two other claimants, in favor of the claimant of Pise, called John XXIII. This Council was illegitimate, certainly, but the same principles were used, as is explained by Muzzarelli.</p> <p>It appears very clearly in this example that to intend the common good of the Church is a requirement of the papacy, and that to not intend this good of the Church would make a pope lose the papacy. In this particular case, the good of the Church was to willingly cooperate in ending the schism by renouncing any claim to the papacy, so as to proceed to a single election that might unite all.</p>  <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#27-another-example-taken-from-church-history">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
