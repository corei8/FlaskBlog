<h3 id="21-the-objective-intention-is-able-to-be-known">21. The objective intention is able to be known.</h3> <p>Although the personal motive can sometimes be very difficult to judge and determine, the objective intention itself can easily become evident. It is sometimes difficult to determine why a person does such and such an action. But the intrinsic end of these actions is usually evident in itself. For example, it might be unclear as to why someone is cultivating land, while it is evident that the intrinsic end of his action is the cultivation of land. It might be unclear as to why someone wants to enter the convent, while it is very clear that this person wants to enter the convent, etc. Hence the argument of the Thesis is not based on the subjective intention of the person, but on the objective intention intrinsic to the very actions posited by the person.</p> <p>Some theologians have thus thought of the hypothesis of a pope who, for example, would not want to exercise the duties of the papacy in its spiritual power, but merely behave as a temporal ruler of the Church's States. This could easily be observed by the Cardinals, who would then have to intervene.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#21-the-objective-intention-is-able-to-be-known">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
