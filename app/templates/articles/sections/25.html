The supreme law of the Church indicates its common good.</h3> <p>Since a law is ordered to the common good, the supreme law of the Church is an accurate indication of its supreme good. This supreme law of the Church is the glory of God and the salvation of souls, salus animarum suprema lex.</p> <p>This salvation of souls can be further explained by considering the threefold mission of the Church: to teach, to rule, and to sanctify the faithful, in order to lead them to heaven. It is therefore clear that the end of the Church includes the preaching of the faith (which demands condemnation of heresy as a consequence), the maintaining of holy disciplinary laws, and the sanctification of the faithful by the administration of sacraments.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#25-the-supreme-law-of-the-church-indicates-its-common-good">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
