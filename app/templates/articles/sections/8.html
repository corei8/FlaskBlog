<h3 id="8-the-vatican-ii-popes-are-not-popes-formally-but-only-materially">8. The Vatican II 'popes' are not popes formally, but only materially.</h3> <p>Now, from the fact that the Vatican II popes have not been infallible in conditions where they should have been can be logically deduced the absence in them of the form of the pontificate, spoken of by St. Robert Bellarmine, viz. the supreme authority given by God to the Roman Pontiff. To this supreme authority is necessarily attached the charism of indefectibility, which is manifestly shown to be lacking in them as a result of the errors of the Second Vatican Council. We can therefore say of them, with certainty: they are not formally popes. God did not give them supreme authority over the Church. However, this argument alone says nothing about the other two determinants mentioned above (legitimate election and acceptance). As far as this argument is concerned, therefore, these popes would still be materially popes, and the opposite would require further proof.</p>  <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#8-the-vatican-ii-popes-are-not-popes-formally-but-only-materially">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
