The acceptance of the papacy is compared to a marriage contract.</h3> <p>The acceptance of the papacy is thus a quasi-contract with Christ and with the Church, and it should therefore not surprise anyone that Thesis-holders, following the steps of past theologians such as Cajetan, Passerini and Bonacina, have compared it to a marriage contract, using this analogy to clearly show how a consent, despite having been given externally, could in fact be insincere and therefore invalid.</p> <p>Bonacina thus explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>Just as marriage cannot be validly celebrated with a infant, or with an insane person during the time of madness or insanity, so neither can he be validly elected to become pope, who does not have the use of reason, since the papacy is like a sort of matrimony between the pope and the Church, as the Doctors teach by a comparison concerning him to whom a benefice is conferred.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bonacina testifies that this analogy is commonly used in theology. Cardinal Cajetan thus compares the consent of the electors and the person elected ("Peter") to the consent given by the spouses in matrimony:</p> <p>Since two consents concur to the bond of marriage, namely, that of the husband and that of the wife, and the total cause of this bond consists in this twofold consent, one spouse cannot cause this bond without the consent of the other spouse. In our case two consents also concur in the establishment of the bond between Peter and the Papacy, namely, that of the electors and that of Peter elected; and both consents taken together are the total cause of this union.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#16-the-acceptance-of-the-papacy-is-compared-to-a-marriage-contract">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
