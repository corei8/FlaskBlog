The very existence of the traditionalist movement is proof positive of this lack of intention.</h3> <p>The answer, for any traditionalist, should be in the affirmative. Any traditional Catholic who refuses the changes of Vatican II and the New Mass as something contrary to the glory of God and the salvation of souls is a living witness to this fact. Thus, Bishop Guérard des Lauriers said: "By its very existence, Ecône witnesses in concrete terms to what we affirm intelligibly." Indeed the entire apostolate of the SSPX is based upon the idea that the preservation of Tradition is necessary for the salvation of souls, and that the present 'hierarchy' and particularly the Vatican II popes are not objectively doing what they should. In this last point they are right.</p> <p>It is obvious to any sincere observer that the Vatican II popes are not exercising the papacy as it has been exercised for centuries, since the time of St. Peter up to Pope Pius XII. Instead, they are taking advantage of the influence of the papacy in order to preach a dogma-less humanism which is in total opposition to the Catholic religion. This is true independently of their subjective intention; but whether they are in good conscience or not, the fact remains that they do not objectively intend the good of the Church.</p> <p>The proofs of this kind have been numerous in number, but they are particularly obvious during the present incumbent Jorge Bergoglio. Of his own accord he set aside the title "vicar of Christ" among the "historical titles", clearly indicating that in his mind the pope is not anymore the vicar of Christ, and does not claim to be so. He has manifested endless efforts to suppress Catholic doctrine, the Catholic Mass, and traditional discipline. He clearly does not intend to be what the pope traditionally is, by the design of Christ Himself.</p> <div class="footnote"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>De Romano Pontifice, Bk.
