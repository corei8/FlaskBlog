<h3 id="6-matter-and-form-in-the-papacy">6. Matter and form in the papacy.</h3> <p>Theologians who have described this process have used the analogous terms of matter and form, which in man, for example, are the body and the soul, respectively. These terms have been applied analogously by philosophers and theologians for making distinctions in the sphere of human morality, in which acts may be valid or invalid. The application of these concepts (matter, form, validity, invalidity) to sacramental theology, for example, is well-known.</p> <p>In the case of the pope, theologians have therefore made a distinction between the subject (the person) receiving the papacy, and the authority of the papacy itself, describing the former as the matter of the papacy, whereas the latter is the form of the papacy. By the process of election and acceptance, a subject, the matter, is prepared and disposed to receive from God the form of the papacy, that is, the supreme authority over the Church. The union of this matter and this form produces a valid pope.</p> <p>St. Robert Bellarmine writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Therefore, when Cardinals create the Pontiff, they exercise their authority not over the Pontiff, because he does not yet exist; but over the matter, that is, over the person whom they dispose in a certain measure through election, that he might receive the form of the pontificate from God.</p> </blockquote> <p>The same distinction is accepted by St. Antoninus and Cardinal Cajetan. It is therefore false to claim, as many have done, that the Thesis is a novelty in applying these distinctions to the papacy.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#6-matter-and-form-in-the-papacy">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
