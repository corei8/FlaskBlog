<h3 id="18-application-to-our-case">18. Application to our case.</h3> <p>The analogy with the acceptance of the papacy should be evident to the reader. Let Fr. Ricossa make it clear for us: "In the same way, the elect of the conclave who has only externally and not truly given his consent to the election is not in the same situation as he was before the conclave (when he was not yet elected) and before the acceptance (when he was only the elect without having given his external acceptance). He is a 'putative' Pontiff [i.e. he appears to be the pope] or materially 'pope' [i.e. having been elected, but not having truly accepted]. The See is occupied by him, and cannot be occupied by someone else for as long as the election has not been declared null by the Church. Certain juridical acts which are indispensable for the life of the Church can have juridical effect (either in themselves, or by suppliance of Christ, Head of the Church) And finally, the acceptance of the election can be validated, by means of the removal of the obstacle which was placed earlier and brought about the defect in the consent..."</p>  <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#18-application-to-our-case">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
