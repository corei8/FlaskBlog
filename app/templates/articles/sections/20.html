What matters is therefore the objective intention, manifested externally which is necessarily included in the subjective intention, which is internal.</h3> <p>We are not here dealing with the personal intention as such, which often can only be observed with difficulty. Hence, strictly speaking, we are not even concerned about the morality of the intention. One could accept to marry for a bad or a good motive, for example, and still marry validly (whether it be for the sake of lust, for the sake of money, or for the sake of having a Catholic family, etc). In either case, it is still possible for the person to accept marriage as it is objectively. The same is true of the papacy: one could accept to become the pope for the sake of vanity, pride, ambition, avarice, etc. This is irrelevant to the problem at hand: one would still accept to become the pope. The intention of which we are speaking of, therefore, is not the finis cujus gratia opus fit, the end for which one does something, which is extrinsic to it, but the very finis operis, the intrinsic end of the work itself.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#20-what-matters-is-therefore-the-objective-intention-manifested-externally-which-is-necessarily-included-in-the-subjective-intention-which-is-internal">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
