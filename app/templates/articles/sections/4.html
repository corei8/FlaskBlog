<h3 id="4-explanation-given-by-the-thesis">4. Explanation given by the Thesis.</h3> <p>The Thesis presents an entirely different argument, based on metaphysical considerations of the act of acceptance of the papacy and the nature of authority. These are two completely distinct arguments within sedevacantism. Adherents to the Thesis reject the totalist conclusion as invalid. The reason for this is that Canon Law clearly indicates that undeclared heretics can validly elect and be elected in the Church (for responses to canonical objections, see section on Canon Law).</p> <p>The proposal of Bishop des Lauriers can be briefly summarized thus: in order to become the pope and receive authority from Christ, the elect must truly accept the papacy.</p>  <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#4-explanation-given-by-the-thesis">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
