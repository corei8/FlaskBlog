The teaching of John of St. Thomas indicates the intention to be requirement of natural law.</h3> <p>This condition necessary for a valid acceptance is not a new condition, implemented by any human law. It rather belongs to the very nature of a human act, and is therefore a necessary condition belonging to the natural law. Such "conditions" of natural law did not need to be positively established by any authority, nor were they rejected by theologians. The Dominican John of St Thomas, for example, enumerates how an election (and by this term he here includes both the vote of the electors and the acceptance by the elect) could be invalid, and explains:</p> <p>Similarly other exceptions of the natural law can be admitted: if the elect is not a man, if he is deprived of reason, etc.</p> <p>Later on, while discussing the question of the universal acceptance of a pope by the universal Church, this great theologian mentions that this would be a sign that the pope "was elected by true electors, and with a real intention, and all the other requirements," "quod a veris electoribus, et per veram intentionem sit electus, et caetera alia requisita." Here, and again a little later in the same article, he clearly indicates explicitly the proper intention of the electors ("intentio eligentium") as an obvious requirement for a valid election, which does apply as well, for an even greater reason, to the act of acceptance, on the part of the elect.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#15-the-teaching-of-john-of-st-thomas-indicates-the-intention-to-be-requirement-of-natural-law">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
