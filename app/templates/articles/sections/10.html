<h3 id="10-role-of-the-acceptance">10. Role of the acceptance.</h3> <p>According to Bonacina, acceptance does not mean that the pope constitutes himself as a pope, or joins the papacy to himself, "because the consent to the election is not the election or creation or constituting of a pope, but a condition required for the complete effect of the election and the constitution of a pope."</p> <p>Cardinal Cajetan teaches similarly:</p> <blockquote> <p>Ever since the immediate institution of the first 'Peter' by Christ Himself, the union between the papacy and Peter does not come from God but from man. This is made evident from the fact that this union is produced through the intermediary of a human election. Two human consents contribute to this effect, namely that of the electors and that of the elect. It is indeed necessary that the electors elect voluntarily, and that the elect accepts the election voluntarily, for otherwise nothing happens.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bonacina says in equivalent terms (ibid.):</p> <blockquote> <p>The fourth condition is that the person elected consent. The reason for this is, first, that no one can begin to possess something in a moral manner without his consent; therefore in order that someone begin to possess the papacy or Pontifical power, his consent is necessary. Also, because by the conferral of the papacy the person elected contracts many obligations, and is obliged as if by a contract (quasi ex contractu); but an obligation from a contract or quasi contract is not contracted without consent, as Cajetan rightly says in chapter 26 of his first book De Comparatione Papae et Concilii.</p> </blockquote> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#10-role-of-the-acceptance">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
