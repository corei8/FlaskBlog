Matter and form of the papacy in the absence of a pope.</h3> <p>When the pope dies, the papacy is thus said to remain under its material aspect in the ability of the Church to elect a successor, and under its formal aspect in Christ, ready to grant authority to the elect. Such is the teaching of St Antoninus (1389-1459):</p> <blockquote> <p>Such [papal] power remains in the Church and in the College [of Cardinals] with respect to that which is material in the papacy, since after the death of the pope the College is able, through election, to determine a person to the papacy, that it be such or such a one. [...] Hence, if by the name of papacy we understand the election and determination of the person (which is the material thing in the papacy, as has been said before) then such power remains in the College after the death of the pope. But if by the name of papal power we understand his authority and jurisdiction (which is the formal thing), then such power never dies, because it always remains in Christ.</p> </blockquote> <p>As long as these two aspects of the papacy remain: the material aspect in the Church, and the formal aspect in Christ, the papacy is not lost. Neither is the teaching of the 1870 Vatican Council denied, which teaches that St. Peter will have perennial successors. To expect Christ to provide not only the formal aspect of the papacy, which is the supreme authority of the pope, but also its material aspect, which is the designation of a man to receive the papacy, would be logically committed to the admission of the loss of Apostolicity in the Roman See and in the universal Church. For even if a pope were named directly from heaven, he would not be the true successor of St. Peter anymore than a man created directly from God without any cooperation from men would be a descendant from Adam. Therefore, any system unable to explain the continuation of the material aspect of the papacy in the Church ought to be abandoned.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#7-matter-and-form-of-the-papacy-in-the-absence-of-a-pope">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
