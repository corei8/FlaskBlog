<h3 id="14-knowledge-and-consent-are-required-for-a-valid-acceptance">14. Knowledge and consent are required for a valid acceptance.</h3> <p>The acceptance of the election is a human act, which therefore ought to be made with proper knowledge and consent; otherwise it would be invalid. Thus a person deprived of the use of reason cannot truly accept the papacy (even if one were to obtain an external expression of acceptance from him), because such a person is incapable of a human act, and therefore also incapable of understanding and accepting the implications of his acceptance. When the elect of the conclave accepts his election to the Sovereign Pontificate, by his very act of accepting the election, he also accepts and assumes the role and functions of the Sovereign Pontificate. The role and functions of the Pontificate are independent of his will; they are found in the very nature of things as established by Christ. He who accepts the papacy agrees to be pope, to fulfill the functions of the papacy, and to embrace the essential properties of this role. And since the finality of the papacy is determined by God, the elect is not allowed to invent it. He could not accept the election with the intention to exercise the papacy as something different than what was established by Christ.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#14-knowledge-and-consent-are-required-for-a-valid-acceptance">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
