<h3 id="26-pope-pius-xii-provides-us-with-an-example-of-one-thing-which-must-be-intended-in-order-to-accept-the-papacy">26. Pope Pius XII provides us with an example of one thing which must be intended in order to accept the papacy.</h3> <p>The Apostolic Constitutions on papal elections do not specify what the acceptance of the election imports. Nevertheless Pope Pius XII himself has indicated at least one thing which the elect should intend: if he be layman, he must intend to be consecrated a bishop in order to be able to accept the election.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Even if a layman were elected pope, he could accept the election only if he were fit for ordination and willing to be ordained."</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed the pope is the bishop of Rome, and as we have said, one must accept the papacy as established by Christ. According to Pope Pius XII, therefore, Christ established the papacy in such a way that the elected candidate must be a bishop, or at least must agree to be consecrated a bishop. Pope Pius XII does not require the layman elected to the papacy to be consecrated a bishop in order to then become the pope; he merely indicates that a non-bishop must have the will to be consecrated a bishop in order to have a proper acceptance of the papacy. The layman, if he did so, would be pope at once, even before being ordained a priest and consecrated a bishop. To be deprived of the power of orders, therefore, does not deprive him of the Pontificate, but of an intention contrary to the Pontificate. A lack of intention to be consecrated a bishop introduces a defect in the consent, and therefore prevents the elect from being able to properly accept the election. This would a fortiori be true of someone who, in a more general way, does not have the habitual intention to procure the good of the Church.</p> <a href="{{ url_for("articles", section="explanation", article="lack-of-intention") }}#26-pope-pius-xii-provides-us-with-an-example-of-one-thing-which-must-be-intended-in-order-to-accept-the-papacy">See in Context</a>{% endblock content %}
